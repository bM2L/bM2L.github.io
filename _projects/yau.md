<b>Abstract</b>:  Natural datasets have intrinsic patterns, which can be summarized as the manifold distribution principle: the distribution of a class of data
is close to a low-dimensional manifold. The manifold fitting problem can go back to the solution to the Whitney extension problem leading to new insights for data interpolation. Assume that we are given a set Y<span>&#8838;</span>&#8477;<sup>D</sup>. When can we construct a smooth d-dimensional submanifold &Mcirc;<span>&#8838;</span>&#8477;<sup>D</sup> to approximate Y , and how well can &Mcirc; estimate Y in terms of distance and smoothness? However, many of these methods rely on restrictive assumptions, making extending them to efficient and workable algorithms challenging. As the manifold hypothesis (non-Euclidean structure exploration) continues to be a foundational element in data science, the manifold fitting problem, merits further exploration and discussion within the modern data science community. The talk will be partially based on some recent works [4, 2, 3, 1 ] along with some on-going progress.
