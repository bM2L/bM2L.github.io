<p><b>Abstract</b>: Curvature is the most important concept of Riemannian geometry, and it has been extended to metric spaces.
Here, I shall develop a notion of curvature that also applies to discrete spaces (as occurring as data samples), links curvature to the concept of hyperconvexity and offers a geometric view on topological data analysis.</p>
