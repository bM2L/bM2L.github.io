We have had to postpone the talk by Charles Fefferman. If you sign up, you will receive information about Kristin Lauter's talk on March 27th. This will be the opening of the 2025 edition of the b=M<sup>2</sup>L colloquium series. In the meantime, you can check the videos of previous talks on our <a href='https://www.youtube.com/@departamentmatematiquesuab121'>Youtube channel</a>.
