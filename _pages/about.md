The Barcelona Mathematics and Machine Learning (<b>b=M<sup>2</sup>L</b>) Colloquium Series aims to bring to a general audience of mathematicians, computer scientists and interested students the <b>interactions between mathematics and machine learning</b>, as well as their <b>latest developments</b>.

What are the mathematics behind machine learning? What can machine learning do for mathematicians? In 2023 we have had lectures by <b>Marc Lackenby</b>, <b>Elizabeth Munch</b> and <b>Jürgen Jost</b>. <a href="2023">Access here the recordings</a> and slides. <a href="sign_up">Sign up</a> if you wish to receive updates about the forthcoming 2024 colloquia.

This activity is organized by the <a href='https://www.uab.cat/web/maths-department-1210142393255.html'>Department of Mathematics at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona</a> with the goal of gathering the Barcelona universities and research centres with the global community. <b>Everyone is welcome to join and contribute! </b> <a href="mailto:%72%6F%62%65%72%74%6F.%72%75%62%69%6F@%75%61%62.%63%61%74" title="email">Contact us.</a>
