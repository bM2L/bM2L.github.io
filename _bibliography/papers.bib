	  abstract={Topological data analysis asks when balls in a metric space (X,d) intersect. Geometric data analysis asks how much balls have to be enlarged to intersect. We connect this principle to the traditional core geometric concept of curvature. This enables us, on one hand, to reconceptualize curvature and link it to the geometric notion of hyperconvexity. On the other hand, we can then also understand methods of topological data analysis from a geometric perspective. },

abstract = {Abstract Shape is data and data is shape. Biologists are accustomed to thinking about how the shape of biomolecules, cells, tissues, and organisms arise from the effects of genetics, development, and the environment. Less often do we consider that data itself has shape and structure, or that it is possible to measure the shape of data and analyze it. Here, we review applications of topological data analysis (TDA) to biology in a way accessible to biologists and applied mathematicians alike. TDA uses principles from algebraic topology to comprehensively measure shape in data sets. Using a function that relates the similarity of data points to each other, we can monitor the evolution of topological features—connected components, loops, and voids. This evolution, a topological signature, concisely summarizes large, complex data sets. We first provide a TDA primer for biologists before exploring the use of TDA across biological sub-disciplines, spanning structural biology, molecular biology, evolution, and development. We end by comparing and contrasting different TDA approaches and the potential for their use in biology. The vision of TDA, that data are shape and shape is data, will be relevant as biology transitions into a data-driven era where the meaningful interpretation of large data sets is a limiting factor.},

This is done by representing some aspect of the structure of the data in a simplified topological signature. In this article, we introduce two of the most commonly used topological signatures. First, the persistence diagram represents loops and holes in the space by considering connectivity of the data points for a continuum of values rather than a single fixed value. The second topological signature, the mapper graph, returns a 1-dimensional structure representing the shape of the data, and is particularly good for exploration and visualization of the data. While these techniques are based on very sophisticated mathematics, the current ubiquity of available software means that these tools are more accessible than ever to be applied to data by researchers in education and learning, as well as all domain scientists.}, number={2}, journal={Journal of Learning Analytics}, author={Munch, Elizabeth}, year={2017}, month={Jul.}, pages={47–61}, html={https://doi.org/10.18608/jla.2017.42.6}, preview={tda.png} }
